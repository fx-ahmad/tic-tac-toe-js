# Tic-Tac-Toe Game Widget

This project provides a simple and embeddable Tic-Tac-Toe game widget for your website. Easily integrate a fun, interactive game for your users with minimal setup.

## Features

- **Customizable Board:** Easily configure the board size (e.g., 3x3, 4x4).
- **Player Symbols:** Define custom symbols for players (e.g., X, O, or emojis).
- **Color Themes:** Adapt the widget's appearance to your website's design with customizable colors for the board and lines.
- **Easy Integration:** Embed the game with a few lines of JavaScript.
- **Lightweight:** Minimal impact on page load times.

## How to Play

The game follows the standard Tic-Tac-Toe rules:

1.  The game is played on a grid (typically 3x3).
2.  One player is assigned a symbol (e.g., 'X') and the other is assigned another symbol (e.g., 'O').
3.  Players take turns placing their symbols in empty cells on the grid.
4.  The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
5.  If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.

To play using the widget:

-   Simply click on an empty cell on the game board to place your symbol.
-   The widget will automatically switch turns between players.
-   The game will indicate when a player has won or if the game is a draw.
